# Binary Bound (in-development)

Binary Bound is a roguelite action game in which two disgraced cyberpunk criminal lackeys must work together to defeat waves of enemies using their katanas and abilities within a two minute time limit. 
If you fail to defeat them all within the time limit, or die trying, the cycle is reset.
However, you will only be able to attack enemies of your same color. To beat the game, you will have to cooperate.
Purchase new abilities and become stronger every new attempt.
Join the fight, collaborate and break the cycle!
